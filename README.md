# Volleyball Player Position Prediction

## Introduction

Volleyball is a popular team sport played worldwide. It requires a combination of skills such as attacking, blocking, serving, setting, digging, and receiving. Understanding the position of each player is crucial for team strategy, player development, and scouting purposes. This project aims to predict the position of volleyball players based on their performance metrics using machine learning techniques.

### Why Volleyball?

From my childhood, I used to play volleyball with my dad, and eventually, I fell in love with the sport. As I continued to play, I realized that positions matter in the team, and different positions require different skills and statistics, especially at the professional level. This project serves as a means to explore the significance of player positions and their impact on team performance.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to apply the concepts learned in university courses to a real-world problem that interests me. By building a predictive model for volleyball player positions, I aim to gain practical experience in machine learning and data analysis while contributing to the volleyball community.

## The Positions

- **OH**: outside hitter
- **OP**: Opposite hitter
- **MB**: Middle blocker
- **S**: Setter
- **L**: Libero

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and datasets used to build machine learning models for predicting volleyball player positions. Each approach or model tested will be documented in separate notebooks or scripts.

## Model Predictions

- Decision Tree Model -> Accuracy: 0.8148148148148148
